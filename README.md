ChefSpec makes it easy to write examples for Opscode Chef cookbooks. Get fast
feedback on cookbook changes before you spin up a node to do integration
against.

ChefSpec runs your cookbook but without actually converging the node that your
examples are being executed on. This has two benefits:

- It's really fast!
- You can write examples that vary node attributes, operating system or search results in order to test thoroughly that your cookbook works correctly.

ChefSpec aims to make Chef development more productive by giving you faster
feedback on cookbook changes.

Start by watching Jim Hopp's excellent [Test Driven Development for Chef Practitioners](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2e0aZUAVGw) talk from ChefConf 2012 which contains lots of great examples of using ChefSpec.

For a really nice walkthrough using ChefSpec with Guard and Fauxhai to do Test
Driven Development watch
[Seth Vargo's TDDing tmux talk](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2364-mwrc2013-tdding-tmux)
from MountainWest RubyConf 2013.

Writing a Cookbook Example
--------------------------
This is an extremely basic Chef recipe that just installs an operating system package.

```ruby
package "foo" do
  action :install
end
```

This is a matching spec file that defines an example that checks that the
package would be installed.

```ruby
require "chefspec"

describe "example::default" do
  let(:chef_run) { ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new.converge 'example::default' }
  it "installs foo" do
    expect(chef_run).to install_package 'foo'
  end
end
```

Let's step through this spec file to see what is happening:

1. At the top of the spec file we require the chefspec gem.
1. The `describe` keyword is part of RSpec and indicates that everything from
   this line up until line 8 is describing the `example::default` recipe.
   Normally the convention is that you would have a separate spec file per
   recipe.
1. The `let` block on line 4 creates the ChefSpec runner and then does a fake
   Chef run with the run list of `example::default`. Any subsequent
   examples can then refer to `chef_run` in order to make assertions about the
   resources that were created during the mock converge.
1. The `it` block on line 5 is an example that specifies that the `foo` package
   should have been installed. Normally you will have multiple `it` blocks per
   recipe, each making a single assertion.

Instead of hardcoding recipe name everywhere, it's possible to use ```described_recipe```
and ```described_cookbook``` methods which for the above example will return ```example::default```
and ```example``` appropriately. These helpers can be used like ```described_class``` is used
in RSpec - to DRY the name of described cookbook/recipe making specs more refactoring proof.

```ruby
require "chefspec"

describe "example::default" do
  let(:chef_run) { ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new.converge described_recipe }
  it "includes another_recipe" do
    expect(chef_run).to include_recipe "#{described_cookbook}::another_recipe"
  end
end
```

Generating an Example
---------------------
Ideally you should be writing your specs in tandem with your recipes and
practicising TDD. However if you have an existing cookbook and you are using
Chef 0.10.0 or greater then ChefSpec can generate placeholder RSpec examples
for you. Knife will automagically detect the ChefSpec Knife Plugin and provide
you with the new `create_specs` subcommand.

You can choose to run this immediately after creating a new cookbook like so:

    $ knife cookbook create -o . my_new_cookbook
    $ knife cookbook create_specs -o . my_new_cookbook

The first command is a Knife built-in and will generate the standard Chef
cookbook structure, including a default recipe. The second is provided by
ChefSpec and will add a `specs` directory and a `default_spec.rb` placeholder.

You'll see the following output:

    ** Creating specs for cookbook: my_new_cookbook

If you look at the generated example you'll see that on line 6 there is a
`pending` keyword indicating where you will later add your cookbook example:

    $ cat -n my_new_cookbook/spec/default_spec.rb

```ruby
require 'chefspec'

describe 'my_new_cookbook::default' do
  let(:chef_run) { ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new.converge 'my_new_cookbook::default' }
  it 'does something' do
    pending 'Your recipe examples go here.'
  end
end
```

You can run the example using rspec:

    $ rspec my_new_cookbook

And you'll see output similar to the following:

    Pending:
      my_new_cookbook::default does something
        # Your recipe examples go here.
        # ./my_new_cookbook/spec/default_spec.rb:5

    Finished in 0.00051 seconds
    1 example, 0 failures, 1 pending

Examples should do more than restate static resources
-----------------------------------------------------
Being able to write examples for simple cases like this is of some use, but
because you declare resources in Chef declaratively it can feel like you are
merely repeating the same resources in example form.

However the recipes that you write using Chef will often declare different
resources based on different inputs:

1. The node attributes for the node converged.
1. The automatically populated node attributes provided by Ohai (operating
   system and version are examples of these).
1. Search results from search queries performed within the recipe.
1. Lookup of values from within databags.

This is where ChefSpec really starts to shine. ChefSpec makes it possible to
write examples for all of the variations of the different inputs above and
make assertions about the created resources. Verifying correct behaviour
for all of the variations with real converges can be incredibly time consuming.
Doing this with real converges is prohibitively slow, but with ChefSpec you can
identify regressions very quickly while developing your cookbook.

Setting node Attributes
-----------------------
You can set node attributes within an individual example. In this example
the value of the `foo` attribute will be set to `bar` on line 3. The example
then asserts that a resource is created based on the attribute name.
In this example the affected resource is a log resource, but it could just as
easily be a template or package name derived from an attribute value.

```ruby
it "logs the foo attribute" do
  chef_run = ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new
  chef_run.node.set['foo'] = 'bar'
  chef_run.converge 'example::default'
  expect(chef_run).to log 'The value of node.foo is: bar'
end
```

A common mistake is to call `#converge` on the runner before setting the node
attributes. If you do this then the attributes will not be set correctly.

```ruby
# !!! Don't do this !!!
it "logs the foo attribute" do
  chef_run = ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new.converge 'example::default'
  chef_run.node.set['foo'] = 'bar'
  expect(chef_run).to log 'The value of node.foo is: bar'
end
```

To avoid this, you can make use of the alternative syntax for specifying node
attributes. Using this approach you pass a block when creating the runner.

```ruby
chef_run = ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new do |node|
  node['my_attribute'] = 'bar'
  node['my_other_attribute'] = 'bar2'
end
chef_run.converge 'example::default'
```

Ohai Attributes
---------------
When you converge a node using Chef a large number of attributes are
pre-populated by Chef which runs
[Ohai](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Ohai) to discover information about
the node it is running on.

You can use these attributes within your cookbooks - the most common usage is
to declare different resources based on the node platform (operating system)
but Ohai ships with a large number of plugins that discover everything from
hardware to installed language interpreters.

It's useful to be able to override these values from within your cookbook
examples in order to assert the resources created on different platforms. In
this way you can explore all of the code paths within your cookbook despite
running the examples on a different platform altogether. Note that line 2
declares the platform underneath `automatic_attrs`.

```ruby
chef_run = ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new
chef_run.node.automatic_attrs['platform'] = 'Commodore 64'
expect(chef_run.converge('example::default')).to log 'I am running on a Commodore 64.'
```

"Missing" Attributes
--------------------
[Fauxhai](https://github.com/customink/fauxhai) from Seth Vargo is now a dependency of ChefSpec. This means you leverage all the power of fauxhai (and it's community contributed ohai mocks) without additional configuration. Just specify the `platform` and `version` attributes when you instantiate your `ChefRunner`:

```ruby
chef_run = ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new(platform:'ubuntu', version:'12.04') do |node|
  node.set['my_attribute'] = 'bar'
  node.set['my_other_attribute'] = 'bar2'
end
chef_run.converge 'example::default'
```

This will include all the default attributes for Ubuntu Precise 12.04. By default, ChefSpec uses the built-in ChefSpec environment (which is minimally configured) for backward compatibility.

For more on Fauxhai
[check out this blog post](http://technology.customink.com/blog/2012/08/03/testing-chef-cookbooks/) from CustomInk.

Search Results
--------------
Chef cookbooks will often make use of search in order to locate other services
within your infrastructure. An example would be a load balancer that searches
for the webservers to add to its pool.

You can use the built-in features within RSpec to stub out responses to search
queries. Given a recipe that searches for webservers:

```ruby
search(:node, 'role:web') do |web_node|
  log "Adding webserver to the pool: #{web_node['hostname']}"
end
```

A example that returned a pre-canned search result to the recipe and then
asserted that it then logged each node added to the pool might look like this:

```ruby
it "logs each node added to the load balancer pool" do
  Chef::Recipe.any_instance.stub(:search).with(:node, 'role:web').and_yield(
    {'hostname' => 'web1.example.com'})
  chef_run = ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new
  chef_run.converge 'my_new_cookbook::default'
  expect(chef_run).to log 'Adding webserver to the pool: web1.example.com'
end
```

Line 2 defines the search response for a search for all nodes with the `web`
role. Line 6 then asserts that the hostname of the returned node is logged as
expected.

Making Assertions
-----------------
Now you have a clear understanding of how to modify the attributes available to
your cookbook it's time to explore the support available in ChefSpec for
expressing assertions.

Each example (within the `it` block) has to specify an assertion to be useful.
An assertion is a statement about the resources created by your Chef run that
the node will be converged against.

### Files

A basic form of assertion is to check that a file is created by a cookbook
recipe. Note that this won't work for files or directories that are not
explicitly declared as resources in the recipe. For example directories created
by the installation of a new package are not known to ChefSpec, it is only
aware of resources that are defined within your cookbooks.

Assert that a directory would be created:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to create_directory '/var/lib/foo'
```

Assert that a directory would be deleted:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to delete_directory '/var/lib/foo'
```

Assert that a directory would have the correct ownership:

```ruby
directory = chef_run.directory('/var/lib/foo')
expect(directory).to be_owned_by('user', 'group')
```

Assert that a file would be created:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to create_file '/var/log/bar.log'
```

Assert that a file would be deleted:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to delete_file '/var/log/bar.log'
```

Assert that a file would have the correct ownership:

```ruby
file = chef_run.file('/var/log/bar.log')
expect(file).to be_owned_by('user', 'group')
```

Assert that a file would have the expected content (matches on partial content):

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to create_file_with_content 'hello-world.txt', 'hello world'
expect(chef_run).to create_file_with_content 'hello-world.txt', /^hello world, your are in the (\d+) day of the year$/
```

Assert that a remote file would be created:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to create_remote_file '/tmp/foo.tar.gz'
```

Assert that a remote file with specific attributes would be created:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to create_remote_file('/tmp/foo.tar.gz').with(
  :source => 'http://www.example.com/foo.tar.gz',
  :checksum => 'deadbeef'
)
```

Assert that a file would be created from cookbook_file ressource:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to create_cookbook_file '/etc/my-cookbook-config.cfg'
file = chef_run.cookbook_file('/var/log/bar.log')
expect(file).to be_owned_by('user', 'group')
expect(file.mode).to eq("0440")
```

Assert that a file would be created from template ressource:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to create_file '/etc/my-cookbook-config.cfg'
file = chef_run.template('/etc/my-cookbook-config.cfg')
expect(file).to be_owned_by('user', 'group')
```

### Packages

Note that only packages explicitly declared in the cookbook will be matched by
these assertions. For example, a package installed only as a dependency of
another package would not be matched.

Assert that a package would be installed:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to install_package 'foo'
```

Assert that a package would be installed at a fixed version:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to install_package_at_version 'foo', '1.2.3'
```

Assert that a package would be removed:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to remove_package 'foo'
```

Assert that a package would be purged:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to purge_package 'foo'
```

You can even use yum packages:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to install_yum_package 'yum-foo'
```

Assert that a package would be upgraded:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to upgrade_package 'foo'
```

All of the assertions above are also valid for use with RubyGems:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to install_gem_package 'foo'
```

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to install_chef_gem 'chef-foo'
```

### Execute

If you make use of the `execute` resource within your cookbook recipes it is
important to guard for idempotent behaviour.

Assert that a command with specific attributes would be run:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to execute_command('whoami > me').with(
  :cwd => '/tmp',
  :creates => '/tmp/me'
)
```

Assert that a command would not be run:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).not_to execute_command 'whoami'
```

### Scripts

You can assert that a script will be executed via the `script` resource or one of
its shortcuts (`bash`, `csh`, `perl`, `python`, `ruby`).

Assert that a Bash script would be run:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to execute_bash_script 'name of bash script'
```

Assert that a Csh script would be run:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to execute_csh_script 'name of csh script'
```

Assert that a Perl script would be run:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to execute_perl_script 'name of perl script'
```

Assert that a Python script would be run:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to execute_python_script 'name of python script'
```

Assert that a Ruby script would be run:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to execute_ruby_script 'name of ruby script'
```

Note: To check for the `ruby_block` resource, use the `execute_ruby_block`
matcher described below.

### Logging

You can assert that a log resource will be created. Note that this assertion
will not match direct use of `Chef::Log`.

Assert that a log statement would be logged:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to log 'A log message from my recipe'
```

Assert that at least one log statement would match a specified regexp:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to log(/bacon \d+/)
```

If you want to be able to view the log output at the console you can control
the logging level when creating an instance of `ChefRunner` as below:

```ruby
let(:chef_run) { ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new(:log_level => :debug) }
```

### Services

Assert that a daemon would be started:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to start_service 'food'
```

Assert that a daemon would be started when the node boots:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to set_service_to_start_on_boot 'food'
```

Assert that a daemon would be stopped:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to stop_service 'food'
```

Assert that a daemon would be restarted:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to restart_service 'food'
```

Assert that a daemon would be reloaded:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to reload_service 'food'
```

### Recipes

Assert that a recipe would be included:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to include_recipe 'foo::bar'
```

### Ruby blocks

Assert that a ruby block would be executed:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to execute_ruby_block 'ruby_block_name'
```

Assert that a ruby block would be executed using a regular expression expectation:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).to execute_ruby_block /ruby/
```

Assert that a ruby block would not be executed:

```ruby
expect(chef_run).not_to execute_ruby_block 'ruby_block_name'
```

### Node attributes

Assert that a node attribute is set:
```ruby
expect(chef_run).to set_node['foo']['bar']
```

Assert that a node attribute is set to a specific value:
```ruby
expect(chef_run).to set_node['foo']['bar'].to 'baz'
```

Assert that a node attribute is not set to a specific value:
```ruby
expect(chef_run).not_to set_node['foo']['bar'].to 42
```

Varying the Cookbook Path
-------------------------
By default ChefSpec will infer the `cookbook_path` from the location of the spec. However if you want to use a different path you can pass it in as an argument to the `ChefRunner` constructor like so:

```ruby
require 'chefspec'

describe 'foo::default' do
  let(:chef_run) {
    runner = ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new({:cookbook_path => '/some/path'})
    runner.converge 'foo::default'
    runner
  }
  it 'installs the foo package' do
    expect(chef_run).to install_package 'foo'
  end
end
```

As of `v1.2.0`, ChefSpc will also automatically look in the following locations for vendored cookbooks:

- vendor/cookbooks
- test/cookbooks
- test/integration (test kitchen)
- spec/cookbooks

This makes it easy to test a cookbook that is using Berkshelf, for example:

    $ bundle exec berks install --path vendor/cookbooks
    $ bundle exec rspec

You don't have to modify the ChefSpec cookbook_path - it is automatically detected.


Mocking Out Environments
------------------------
If you want to mock out `node.chef_environment`, you'll need to use RSpec mocks/stubs twice:

```ruby
let(:chef_run) do
  ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new do |node|
    # Create a new environment (you could also use a different :let block or :before block)
    env = Chef::Environment.new
    env.name 'staging'

    # Stub the node to return this environment
    node.stub(:chef_environment).and_return env.name

    # Stub any calls to Environment.load to return this environment
    Chef::Environment.stub(:load).and_return env
  end.converge 'cookbook::recipe'
end
```


See #54 for the in-depth discussion.

Writing examples for LWRP's
---------------------------
By default ChefSpec will override all resources to take no action. In order to allow
your LWRP to be run, you have to explicitly tell `ChefRunner` to step into it:

```ruby
require 'chefspec'

describe 'foo::default' do
  let(:chef_run) {
    runner = ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new(:step_into => ['my_lwrp'])
    runner.converge 'foo::default'
  }
  it 'installs the foo package through my_lwrp' do
    expect(chef_run).to install_package 'foo'
  end
end
```

Resource Guards
---------------
Chef resources may use the `not_if` or `only_if`
[conditional execution attributes](http://docs.opscode.com/resource_common_conditionals.html)
to check whether a resource should be applied.

By default ChefSpec will not evaluate these guards. There are two reasons for
this default:

* Guards may contain any Ruby or Shell code. It's not possible for ChefSpec to
  know if running the guard may have side effects that harm your workstation.
* Guards may assume state or command-line utilities that aren't present on your
  workstation. Typically you will mock these out but ChefSpec doesn't force you
  to do this.

## Evaluating Guards

You can tell ChefSpec to evaluate any `only_if` or `not_if` attributes present
on your resources when you instantiate the `ChefRunner`:

```ruby
let(:chef_run) do
  chef_run = ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new({:evaluate_guards => true})
  chef_run.converge 'example::default'
end
```

## Mocking out file operations in Ruby blocks

Given a conditional that uses Ruby to check for the existence of a file:

```ruby
template "/etc/app/config" do
  only_if{ File.exists?("/opt/app/installed") }
end
```

We can mock out both cases so that we check that our recipe behaves correctly
when the file is present or not:

```ruby
require "chefspec"
describe "example::default" do
  let(:chef_run){ ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new({:evaluate_guards => true}) }
  before(:each){ File.stub(:exists?).and_call_original }
  it "should render the template if the install file exists" do
    File.should_receive(:exists?).with("/opt/app/installed").and_return(true)
    chef_run.converge "example::default"
    expect(chef_run).to create_file("/etc/app/config")
  end
  it "should not render the template if the install file doesn't exist" do
    File.should_receive(:exists?).with("/opt/app/installed").and_return(false)
    chef_run.converge "example::default"
    expect(chef_run).not_to create_file("/etc/app/config")
  end
end
```

## Stubbing results of shell guards

Given a shell guard that uses Ruby to check for the existence of a file:

```ruby
template "/etc/app/config" do
  only_if "test -f /opt/app/installed"
end
```

If we set `:evaluate_guards => true` then the presence of any unstubbed shell
guards will result in test failures:

```
Failures:

  1) example::default should render the template if the install file exists
     Failure/Error: chef_run.converge "example::default"
       The following shell guard was unstubbed: only_if command `test -f /opt/app/installed`
```

We can mock out both cases so that we check that our recipe behaves correctly
when the file is present or not:

```ruby
require "chefspec"
  describe "example::default" do
    let(:chef_run){ ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new({:evaluate_guards => true}) }
    it "should render the template if the install file exists" do
      chef_run.stub_command(/test/, true)
      chef_run.converge "example::default"
      expect(chef_run).to create_file("/etc/app/config")
    end
    it "should not render the template if the install file doesn't exist" do
      chef_run.stub_command(/test/, false)
      chef_run.converge "example::default"
      expect(chef_run).not_to create_file("/etc/app/config")
    end
end
```

## Actually running shell guards

If it makes sense to actually run shell guards on the workstation your examples
are running on then you can tell ChefSpec you want it to do so:

```ruby
require "chefspec"
  describe "example::default" do
    let(:chef_run) do
      ChefSpec::ChefRunner.new(
        {:evaluate_guards => true, :actually_run_shell_guards => true})
    end
    it "should render the template if the install file exists" do
      chef_run.converge "example::default"
      expect(chef_run).to create_file("/etc/app/config")
    end
end
```
